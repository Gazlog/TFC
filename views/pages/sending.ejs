        <h2>Sending</h2>
        <p>
            You send a short message of <strike>twenty-five</strike> ______ words or less to a creature with whom you are familiar. The creature <strike>hears the message in its mind</strike> reads the message in a log, <strike>recognizes you as the sender if it knows you</strike> recognizes you as the sender only if an email is included, and can answer in a like manner (if an email address is included). The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesnâ€™t arrive.
